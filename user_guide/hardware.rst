System Overview
===============

This section will provide an overview of the system hardware, as well as
a diagrammatic sketch of the sytem layout. 

There are multiple ways in which the new memory can be applied, and the
different modes each have specific uses and methods associated with them.
The various applications of the memory are summarised in the section `Memory
Modes`_.

Different uses of the memory: NVRAM: MemDirect, AppDirect (?), and storage. 
 

Layout

Schematic overview of the system (possibly again for the different memory
modes).
