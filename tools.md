# Tools

## ArmForge

The Arm Forge tool is available for debugging and profiling. This encompasses two tools previously available separately, DDT and MAP. It can be used in either the GUI mode or via the command line.

It is available on Fulhame by loading the module via the module system:
```
module load ArmForge
```
and the GUI is available by invoking:
```
$> forge
```

Full documentation for the usage of Forge is available from [Arm](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/server-and-hpc/help/help-and-tutorials)

## Hardware counters

The Fulhame system has hardware counters available for use with MAP via a plugin, contact [support](mailto:epcc-support@epcc.ed.ac.uk?subject=Fulhame Counters).
